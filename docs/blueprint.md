## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#1E3A8A) to convey trust and reliability, given that this is a marketing website. The goal is a calm but professional look.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F9FF). It's a lighter tint of the primary hue, supporting a clean look in the light color scheme.
- Accent color: Violet (#7C3AED). It's an analogous color, which stands out against the primary color to highlight key UI elements.
- Body: 'Inter', a sans-serif font providing a clean and modern look. Headline: 'Space Grotesk', for a modern and slightly techy look.
- Use consistent, minimalist icons that align with the digital signage theme.
- Mobile-first design with a clean and responsive layout.
- Subtle animations to improve user experience without being distracting.
